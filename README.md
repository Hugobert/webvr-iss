See the world from inside the ISS in VR, inside your browser

## What is this?
This is a project I'm working on for the University of Applied Sciences Aschaffenburg.

The user shall sit inside an area that resembles the Cupola platform that is part of the Tranquility module of the International Space Station. The position is updated according to the current position of the ISS. The user shall be able to interact with certain elements to experiment with the immersion. All of this shall be rendered in 3D and be usable with a range of Virtual Reality headsets and mobile phones.

Even if the paper that goes along with this project is finished, development on this project will continue.
